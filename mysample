I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to formally resign from my role, as the chances of a contract extension appear to be minimal. Given the circumstances, I have accepted a temporary opportunity that better supports my current family situation.

I want to sincerely thank you and the entire team for the support, guidance, and collaboration during my time here. It has been a rewarding experience, and Iâ€™ve truly valued being part of the team.

Should there be any opportunities in the future, I would be very keen to return and contribute again.
